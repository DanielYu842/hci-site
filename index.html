      <h2 id="p1-title">Project 1 — Friendly Campus for Atlantis Underwater Visitors</h2>
      <p>HKUST will host visiting mermaid students from Atlantis. We need to adapt our land campus to their body, habits, and culture. This page introduces the project and links to my diary and reflection.</p>

          <h3>Description & Goal</h3>
          <p><strong>POV</strong>: A mermaid exchange student needs water‑based infrastructure and learning tools. Their anatomy and habits do not fit a dry, stair‑filled, screen‑based campus. They should be able to study well and live comfortably in HK. They should also be able to order food easily at cafeteria kiosks.</p>
          <h4>Needs & Obstacles</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Mobility</strong>: Escalators, stairs, and long paths are hard for mermaids. They need water slides, swim tubes, and water elevators so they can move without leaving water.</li>
            <li><strong>Academic</strong>: Paper and normal electronics get wet and stop working. They need waterproof devices and materials so they can study and take notes.</li>
            <li><strong>Health</strong>: Dry air dehydrates them. They need easy access to seawater hydration stations and humid spaces. For long dry routes, wearable water enclosures could help them stay comfortable.</li>
            <li><strong>Social</strong>: Food and clubs are mostly designed for land students. They often eat fish and seaweed, so more aquatic cuisine and inclusive activities would help them join campus life.</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Project Goal</strong>: Design campus policies, infrastructure, and tools so mermaid students can study, socialize, and live well. We will start with cafeteria kiosks: make the ordering flow easy with wet hands, using a waterproof stylus and bigger targets.</p>

          <h3>Learning & Execution Process</h3>
          <h4>Needfinding</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>We wrote down the basic facts about our users. Mermaids have wet fingertips, a tail instead of legs, and need water often. They can breathe on land for some time and are very strong swimmers. This tells us where normal campus design may fail.</li>
            <li>We listed problems in four areas: moving around campus, doing school work, staying healthy, and joining the community. This helps us see the full picture before we pick one area to fix.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Ideation</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Infrastructure</strong>: We imagined ways to move in water across campus. Ideas include water‑filled tunnels, waterslides, swim tubes, water elevators, and hydration domes. These ideas remove the need to be dry and make travel easier.</li>
            <li><strong>Social & cultural</strong>: We proposed aquatic dining halls, mixed land‑sea sports, and events that both land students and mermaids can enjoy. This reduces social barriers and food problems.</li>
            <li><strong>Tools</strong>: We suggested waterproof laptops and tablets, small water scooters for long trips, and a waterproof stylus for kiosks. For this project, we focus on the kiosk flow for wet hands because it is small, testable, and useful.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Personal Contributions & Achievements</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Led early brainstorming and created the initial mermaid persona.</li>
            <li>Narrowed the problem scope and chose the school domain to focus on.</li>
            <li>Took detailed notes during group work to capture decisions and evidence.</li>
            <li>Facilitated group discussions to align on the POV and next steps.</li>
            <li>Presented our findings and rationale in the final in-class presentation.</li>
            <li>Applied accessibility thinking: wet hands, tail mobility, and hydration needs.</li>
            <li>Used usability heuristics (visibility, error prevention, match to users) to judge ideas.</li>
            <li>Mapped task flows for kiosk ordering to find pain points and quick wins.</li>
          </ul>
        </article>

          <h3>Personal Reflection</h3>
          <p>Designing for mermaid students forced me to put accessibility first. A kiosk that works for dry hands and upright posture will fail when hands are wet and users have a tail. I learned to translate these physical constraints into interface choices: bigger touch targets, higher contrast, short steps, and clear recovery when water causes input errors.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Accessibility focus</strong>: Support wet‑hand input (moisture‑robust touch and a waterproof stylus), generous target sizes, readable typography, and strong contrast. Keep controls in easy‑to‑reach zones for users who cannot stand close or upright.</li>
            <li><strong>Universal design</strong>: Multimodal input (touch + stylus), captions for any audio, and plain language labels help both mermaid and land students.</li>
            <li><strong>Process mindset</strong>: Start with low‑fi wireflows, test with short, observable tasks (place an order, edit an item, pay), and track time on task and error rate to guide iterations.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Overall, accessibility constraints did not limit creativity; they focused it. By designing for the hardest case (wet hands, non‑standard posture), the kiosk becomes simpler and better for everyone.</p>
