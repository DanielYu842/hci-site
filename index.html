      <h2 id="p1-title">Project 1 — Friendly Campus for Atlantis Underwater Visitors</h2>
      <p>HKUST will host visiting mermaid students from Atlantis. We need to adapt our land campus to their body, habits, and culture. This page introduces the project and links to my diary and reflection.</p>

      <div class="p1-grid">
        <article class="card">
          <h3>Description & Goal</h3>
          <p><strong>POV</strong>: A mermaid exchange student needs water‑based infrastructure and learning tools. Their anatomy and habits do not fit a dry, stair‑filled, screen‑based campus. They should be able to study well and live comfortably in HK. They should also be able to order food easily at cafeteria kiosks.</p>
          <h4>Needs & Obstacles</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Mobility</strong>: Escalators, stairs, and long paths are hard for mermaids. They need water slides, swim tubes, and water elevators so they can move without leaving water.</li>
            <li><strong>Academic</strong>: Paper and normal electronics get wet and stop working. They need waterproof devices and materials so they can study and take notes.</li>
            <li><strong>Health</strong>: Dry air dehydrates them. They need easy access to seawater hydration stations and humid spaces. For long dry routes, wearable water enclosures could help them stay comfortable.</li>
            <li><strong>Social</strong>: Food and clubs are mostly designed for land students. They often eat fish and seaweed, so more aquatic cuisine and inclusive activities would help them join campus life.</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Project Goal</strong>: Design campus policies, infrastructure, and tools so mermaid students can study, socialize, and live well. We will start with cafeteria kiosks: make the ordering flow easy with wet hands, using a waterproof stylus and bigger targets.</p>
        </article>

        <article class="card">
          <h3>Learning & Execution Process</h3>
          <h4>Needfinding</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>We wrote down the basic facts about our users. Mermaids have wet fingertips, a tail instead of legs, and need water often. They can breathe on land for some time and are very strong swimmers. This tells us where normal campus design may fail.</li>
            <li>We listed problems in four areas: moving around campus, doing school work, staying healthy, and joining the community. This helps us see the full picture before we pick one area to fix.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Ideation</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Infrastructure</strong>: We imagined ways to move in water across campus. Ideas include water‑filled tunnels, waterslides, swim tubes, water elevators, and hydration domes. These ideas remove the need to be dry and make travel easier.</li>
            <li><strong>Social & cultural</strong>: We proposed aquatic dining halls, mixed land‑sea sports, and events that both land students and mermaids can enjoy. This reduces social barriers and food problems.</li>
            <li><strong>Tools</strong>: We suggested waterproof laptops and tablets, small water scooters for long trips, and a waterproof stylus for kiosks. For this project, we focus on the kiosk flow for wet hands because it is small, testable, and useful.</li>
          </ul>

            <li>Mapped task flows for kiosk ordering to find pain points and quick wins.</li>
          </ul>
        </article>

        <article class="card">
          <h3>Personal Reflection</h3>
          <p>Designing for mermaid students forced me to put accessibility first. A kiosk that works for dry hands and upright posture will fail when hands are wet and users have a tail. I learned to translate these physical constraints into interface choices: bigger touch targets, higher contrast, short steps, and clear recovery when water causes input errors.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Accessibility focus</strong>: Support wet‑hand input (moisture‑robust touch and a waterproof stylus), generous target sizes, readable typography, and strong contrast. Keep controls in easy‑to‑reach zones for users who cannot stand close or upright.</li>
            <li><strong>Universal design</strong>: Multimodal input (touch + stylus), captions for any audio, and plain language labels help both mermaid and land students.</li>
            <li><strong>Process mindset</strong>: Start with low‑fi wireflows, test with short, observable tasks (place an order, edit an item, pay), and track time on task and error rate to guide iterations.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Overall, accessibility constraints did not limit creativity; they focused it. By designing for the hardest case (wet hands, non‑standard posture), the kiosk becomes simpler and better for everyone.</p>

      <div class="p1-grid">
        <article class="card">
          <h3>Description & Goal</h3>
          <p>This project explores how students cope with food access during typhoons while living in HKUST dorms. Many students do not have full kitchens and cannot easily buy groceries when stores and canteens close. Our goal is to design a chatbot that helps students make quick meals with what they already have, reduces stress, and provides clear, supportive guidance during emergencies.</p>
        </article>

        <article class="card full-width">
          <h3>Part 1: Empathize</h3>
          
          <h5>Observe / Interview</h5>
          <p>During Typhoon Ragasa, Emily (Hall 4 Resident) couldn't leave campus to buy groceries. Nearby stores were nearly empty, and Hall 4's shared kitchen created long queues."“I only had a few cans of soup and instant noodles left. The store was out of vegetables and eggs, and our dorm only has a stove… I had to wait a long time to use it.”</p>
          <p>Our interview transcript captured Emily's struggles with grocery access during the typhoon, long kitchen queues, and limited ingredients. Our observations documented the differences between halls with full kitchens versus those with only microwaves, the suspension of delivery services, early canteen closures, and safety restrictions on cross-hall kitchen use.</p>
          
          <h5>Additional Observations</h5>
          <p>Halls without kitchens (e.g., Hall 9) often have only microwaves and water dispensers. Delivery suspended; canteens closed early; rationing created uncertainty. Borrowing kitchens across halls was restricted for safety.</p>

          <h5>Scenario: Typhoon Season in Student Dorms</h5>
          <p>A voice/chat agent could provide real-time updates on open canteens and stores. It could suggest simple recipes using current ingredients and appliances (e.g., microwave-only). It could coordinate shared kitchen use or food-sharing among hallmates. It could offer safety tips and supportive messaging to reduce anxiety.</p>

          <h3>Part 2: Ideate</h3>
        
          <h4>Task 1 — Point of View (POV)</h4>
          <p>From our interviews, we learned that many students struggle to eat properly during typhoons. Canteens may close, ingredients are limited, and most dorms only have basic kitchen tools. Students often end up eating instant noodles or skipping meals. They want fast, simple help and clear guidance on how to cook with what they already have.</p>
        
          <p>We explored whether a chatbot could help by showing which canteens are still open, coordinating shared kitchen use, or suggesting easy microwave-based meals. Our goal was to create a chatbot that provides comfort, clear instructions, and practical recipes that work in dorm conditions.</p>
        
          <p><strong>POV Statement:</strong><br>
          A student stuck on campus during a typhoon needs quick, appliance-aware meal suggestions and reliable food access information because kitchens are limited, stores may be closed, and stress is high.</p>
        
          <hr>
        
          <h4>Task 2 — Brainstorming: Chatbot Ideas</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Ingredient-to-Recipe Bot:</strong> Enter ingredients → receive simple recipes matched to available appliances (text or voice guidance).</li>
            <li><strong>Cooking Guide Bot:</strong> Hands-free voice steps (“what’s next?”) for beginner-friendly cooking.</li>
            <li><strong>Food Availability Bot:</strong> Shows which canteens/stores are open with maps or walking time.</li>
            <li><strong>Shared Kitchen Bot:</strong> See stove/microwave availability and coordinate ingredient swaps.</li>
            <li><strong>Smart Shopping Bot:</strong> Sends pre-typhoon reminders with short grocery checklists.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Part 3: Prototype</h3>
        
          <h4>Prototype Iterations</h4>
        
          <h5>First Iteration</h5>
          <p>We began with a simple chatbot where users typed their available ingredients and received one or two quick recipe suggestions. This showed the core idea clearly but did not feel very personalized.</p>
        
          <div>
            <img src="proj2/proto1.jpeg" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;border-radius:8px;border:1px solid var(--border);margin-top:8px;" />
          </div>

          <h5>Second Iteration</h5>
          <p>We added more user preferences such as diet type, allergies, and ingredient restrictions. However, during testing, students said it felt too slow and overwhelming, especially during stressful typhoon conditions.</p>
        
          <div>
            <img src="proj2/proto2.jpeg" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;border-radius:8px;border:1px solid var(--border);margin-top:8px;" />
          </div>

          <h5>Third Iteration</h5>
          <p>We simplified setup to only the essential preferences (e.g., dietary type and appliance availability). Users could immediately start entering ingredients. This made the chatbot faster and calmer to use, and this version became our main prototype moving forward.</p>
        
          <div>
            <img src="proj2/proto3.png" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;border-radius:8px;border:1px solid var(--border);margin-top:8px;" />
          </div>
        </article>

        <article class="card full-width">
          <h3>Part 4: User Testing</h3>
        
          <p>We tested our final chatbot, <strong>Typhood</strong>, using a Google Form. Students rated ease of use, usefulness, and the quality of recipe suggestions. We also collected open-ended feedback about what felt helpful and what needed improvement.</p>
        
          <h4>Initial Feedback</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Users wanted a short guide explaining how to start using the chatbot.</li>
            <li>The early setup asked too many questions and felt overwhelming.</li>
            <li>A simple logo or visual identity would help the chatbot feel more memorable.</li>
            <li>Speech input would make listing ingredients faster and easier.</li>
          </ul>
        
          <h4>After Iteration</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>The chatbot became easier and faster to use.</li>
            <li>Users liked that Typhood adjusted recipes based on available appliances.</li>
            <li>Both text and speech input worked well for casual ingredient input.</li>
            <li>Some users suggested adding photos to help compare and choose meal options quickly.</li>

          <h3>Use of AI</h3>
          <p>I used generative AI to help draft the prototypes and think of user testing questions. Final design decisions, feature prioritization, and prototype layout were made by our team based on interview feedback and user testing results.</p>

            <li>Led development of the prototype, features and demos</li>
            <li>Designed and iterated on the UI across all three prototypes.</li>
            <li>Ran multiple user testing sessions and synthesized feedback into clear design changes.</li>

        <article class="card">
          <h3>Personal Reflection</h3>
          <p>I learned that even small barriers in setup or onboarding can discourage use during stressful situations. People want tools that feel calm, fast, and supportive. Reducing steps and decision-making load mattered more than adding features. In the next iteration, I want to improve recipe clarity, add images to help users choose faster, and explore voice-first interaction more deeply.</p>
